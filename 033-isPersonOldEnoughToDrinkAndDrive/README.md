# `033` isPersonOldEnoughToDrinkAndDrive

## 📝 Instructions:

1. Write a function called `isPersonOldEnoughToDrinkAndDrive`. Given a `person` object, that contains an `age` property, `isPersonOldEnoughToDrinkAndDrive` returns `true` if the given person is old enough to legally drink and drive in the United States. Otherwise it returns `false`.

## Example:

```Javascript
var obj = {
  age: 45
};
var output = isPersonOldEnoughToDrinkAndDrive(obj);
console.log(output); // --> false
```

## 💡 Hints:

+ The legal drinking age in the United States is 21.

+  The legal driving age in the United States is 16.

+ It is always illegal to drink and drive in the United States 😆.
