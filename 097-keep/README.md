# `097` keep

## 📝 Instructions: 

1. Write a function called `keep`. Given an array and a keeper element, `keep` returns an array containing the items that match the given keeper element.

## Example:

```js
var output = keep([1, 2, 3, 2, 1], 2) 
console.log(output); --> [2, 2]
```

## 💡 Hint:

+ If no elements match, "keep" should return an empty array.
